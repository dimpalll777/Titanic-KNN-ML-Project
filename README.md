 # 🚢 Titanic-KNN-Classification

This project is part of **Task 6** of the AI & ML Internship. The goal is to implement the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using the **Titanic dataset** to predict passenger survival.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a KNN classification model using Scikit-learn that predicts whether a passenger survived based on features like class, age, sex, and fare.
